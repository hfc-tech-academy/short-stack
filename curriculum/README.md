# The Curriculum

## Weeks -âˆž through 0
So before you show up, you need to work through all of the [prep-work](https://github.com/hfc-tech-academy/short_stack/tree/master/prep_work).  It's important that you understand most of the language we will be using, as well as have a general idea how to program and format your code for readability.
