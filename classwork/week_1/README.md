# Tuesday - Welcome, setup, playing around

Today we will: 

* hear from the founders
* make sure we have our environments set up
* play with git
* play around with rails, bootstrap, and html

### Things to get comfortable with

#### Rails commands for today

* `rails new playground`
* `rails g controller controller_name first_page second_page etc_page`

#### Git commands for today

* `git init`
* `git add -A`
* `git commit -m "stuffstuffstuff"`

#### Command line commands for today

* `ls`, `cd`
* `touch file_name` (or, in windows `type nul > file_name`)
  * **N.B.** `type nul > file_name` is a great way (read: horrible way) to overwrite data in an existing file.  You should probably just use your file editor to create new files.
