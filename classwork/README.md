# Classwork

## Overview

In general, each day will feature either one of the projects we're working on as a class, or a day of instruction and exploration of one of the many topics necessary to understand the full picture.  Also, on any given day there will be time for you to ask questions about the previous days work and readings, as well as occasional guest speakers to provide real world context about the technologies we're implementing, and the environments you'll be involved in.

#### Monday - General Instruction & Review

On Mondays we'll have time to go over anything we struggled with the previous week, answer questions about the weekend homework, and get ready for the demands and challenges for the week ahead.

#### Tuesday - Gitocracy

Tuesdays we'll be creating a website that combines all the fun of coding with keeping track of everything you do.  It's a place to share your coding accomplishments, earn badges, and socialize with other coders.

#### Wednesday - Daft Magazine

Here we'll be working on a magazine website.  It will feature user submitted articles, content organized by subject, monetization, and public discussion of articles.  

#### Thursday - Alumni Forum

Here's where the class gets to create the website all future classes will be using to connect with each other.  It'll be a place to keep in contact with students in your cohort, keep up to date on job news, and generally ask questions about the things you're learning.

#### Friday - Quick Apps

Friday will feature a sequence of apps that can be completed in one day.  Mostly they'll be one pagers, featuring clean design and a focus on functionality.  They'll be the place were we explore JavaScript and jQuery, to become expert enough to use it fluidly within the context of the other applications.

## Personal Project

In addition to the projects you're designing on the weekdays, it'll be important for you to come up with a personal project that you will implement both in your own time during the early weeks, and then refine during the final week.  The easiest sort of personal projects are ones that duplicate existing functionality from popular web applications.  

Things like Tumblr, Twitter, and anything else which starts with a T and ends with an r are good candidates.  You and everyone else know how they work, and can gauge your success on how closely it works and looks like the original.  We call the projects clones, and you should start thinking of a website, and a few main features you might want to clone.  We'll help you through the process of creating a prototype, and talk about how to implement the clone as you go.
