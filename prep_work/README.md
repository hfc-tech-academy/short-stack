# So you're joining us?
Great!  We're really exited to have you!  Since you've made it this far, we know you're just like us: lifetime learners who get totally pumped when faced with new things.  

Since we want you to do your best, it's important you go through the things on this list *before* showing up for the first day.  The course is short enough and the material deep enough that if you don't prepare, it's possible to be overwhelmed quickly.  

Here's a list of things to do.  Each assignment is pretty short, but they will help you understand the technologies we'll be using deeply enough to stay afloat.  

### Set up your computer
Ok, so you're bringing your own computer for this class.  It's important, since you're going to be doing so much work outside of class, to make sure you are set up correctly to work efficiently from day 1. (and before, in order to do the appropriate homework!)

**N.B.** Think deeply about implementing a nice clean start.  Clearing off your computer and reinstalling the newest operating system is not only cathartic, but a great way to make sure everything works well together.

1. RVM, Ruby, Rails:  
	1. In terminal run (*mind the backslash!*) `$ \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby`.  
		This will install [Ruby Version Manager](https://rvm.io) as well as the current stable version of [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).  
		Test that things are working by typing `$ irb` and making sure you're inside a ruby command line.  
		It should look like `2.1.2 :001 >`.  Type `puts 3 + 5` and you should get `8 => nil` back.  Good?  Good.  
	2. Now run `$ gem install rails`  
		Test that this is working by typing `$ rails new app`  
		It's working if you get a million lines of `create ...` followed by another million lines of `Using ...`.  
		You can now delete the app by typing `$ rm -rf app`.
2. Javascript: Go to [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) and install the latest package.  
3. Editor: We'll use [Textmate](http://macromates.com/download) during the course.  It's flexible, free, and terrific.
4. Chat: We'll use [Hipchat](http://hipchat.com) for class purposes.  It's a nice little chat package that you can run on any platform, and it's a great way to get my attention.


### Set up your life
Here's a list of places you'll need to have an account for during the course of the course:

- [github](https://github.com/)
- [tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com/)
- Hipchat, but you'll get an invite for that from us.

### Git
Git is all about version control.  You'll be working on large projects, and some days you'll write hundreds of lines of code.  Sometimes that code will break and you'll need to go back to a working version.

The following three resources are a great introduction to Git:

- Code School's [trygit](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
- [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book)
- [Git in Action](http://vimeo.com/16395537)

### HTML & CSS
Go to the [HTML & CSS]() Curriculum, and do the Preweekend assignments before showing up.
