#Welcome
You're about to embark on a rapid-fire journey into web development.  This course covers just about everything, from web design to back-end.  It's so quick we've decided to call it the short stack.  Thankfully we're close enough to Canada to enjoy some mapley goodness.

##Weeks -âˆž through 0
So before you show up, you need to work through all of the [prep-work](https://github.com/hfc-tech-academy/short_stack/tree/master/prep_work).  It's important that you understand most of the language we will be using, as well as have a general idea how to program and format your code for readability.  These things will be reinforced and expanded upon, but by strengthing yourself before showing up you'll do that much better.

##HTML/CSS
The course will start off with [HTML and CSS](https://github.com/hfc-tech-academy/html_css).

##Bootstrap
We then build upon HTML and CSS by introducing [Bootstrap](https://github.com/hfc-tech-academy/bootstrap).

##Ruby
Then we take a breather to play around in straight [Ruby](https://github.com/hfc-tech-academy/ruby).

##Rails
Next it all comes together when we add back-end development to our skillset by learning [Rails](https://github.com/hfc-tech-academy/rails).

##JavaScript/jQuery
Finally we make pages come alive with [Javascript and jQuery](https://github.com/hfc-tech-academy/javascript_jquery).
