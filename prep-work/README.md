# So you're joining us?

Great!  We're really exited to have you!  Since you've made it this far, we know you're just like us: lifetime learners who get totally pumped when faced with new things.  

Since we want you to do your best, it's important you go through the things on this list *before* showing up for the first day.  The course is short enough and the material deep enough that if you don't prepare, it's possible to be overwhelmed quickly.  

Here's a list of things to do.  Each assignment is pretty short, but they will help you understand the technologies we'll be using deeply enough to stay afloat.  

### Git
Git is all about version control.  You'll be working on large projects, and some days you'll write hundreds of lines of code.  Sometimes that code will break and you'll need to go back to a working version.

The following three resources are a great introduction to Git:
