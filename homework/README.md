# Welcome to your next six weeks

One of the most important things you're going to do during this course is to spend time reflecting on what you're building, as well as expanding your knowledge base so that you can build a variety of things faster, better, and more efficiently.  We've organized the work you need to do by week.  Make sure you do as much of the homework before showing up to class so that you can ask questions about the material, as well as contribute to your pairings.
